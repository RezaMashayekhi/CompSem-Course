# Computational-Semantic-Course

Created a bilingual wordnet by doing parallel WSD on a bitext. Also created a silver training dataset in Persian

The annotated Bitext is in "output/Generated senses and taggs". It has two folders English and Farsi. Each have xml and key files for the whole Bitext and blind sample separately.

The generated multiunit exists in output/multinet along with its sample.

Code are in "Code". Inside code there are two codes. They use java api for converting wn to bn senses and finding first sense (b.java and a.java respectively).  "Java/Babel/src". Three other new java files are added which their package name should clarify their task.
